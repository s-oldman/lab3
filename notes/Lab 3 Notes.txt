TODOs for Lab 3 Driver file (everything else is done):
  ✓ Package issue: Fixed! (Just had to use separate repos for each lab.)
  ✓ (i think this is done?) Refactor: Use enums for MainMenuOption, CustomerUpdateSubmenuOption
  ✓ Update customerPurchase() to displayCustomerList() & only prompt for a Customer's name if they're not in customerData (& in that case, add them to customerData)
 ✓ changeCustomerName()
  ✓ Do a quick println() saying what you're doing
  ✓ Prompt for a valid account number (if it doesn't exist, show an error & re-prompt until a valid one's entered)
    * Ed: No. If it doesn't exist, back out to the submenu. Don't force someone to munge a record just to get out of the prompt.
  ✓ Prompt for a new name
  ✓ Modify Customer.Name in the list (don't just remove the customer & add a new one!)
 ✓ saveToFile()
  * Prompt for filename
  * Create file (if you can't, show an error & return to main)
  * Write the CustomerData List out to the file in the exact same format as CustFile.txt (again, show an error if you can't write to the file):
	Customer Name 1\cr\lf
	Account Number 1\cr\lf
	Cusomter Name 2\cr\lf
	Account Number 2\eof
* returnToMainMenu()
  * Test if the file was changed & the user didn't save anything:
    * If nothing changed, or if the user saved, just return to main
    * If it did & they didn't, prompt the user [Y/N] to ask if they want to save their changes (anything other than "Y", "y", "N", or "n" should show an error & re-prompt)

Lab 3 Rubric:
* (5 pts) Code has updated javadoc on all files.
* (5 pts) There are no hard coded numbers; all numeric input has correct validation using final variables and appropriate method calls; all read and write to files is validated.
* (5 pts) Code has updated Customer Class and interface file as per the instructions.
* (15 pts) Code contains a CustomerData Class that contains the instance variable and the methods defined in the instructions. The Class uses an Iterable, Serializable unordered List
* (15 pts) Driver file contains new submenu and performs actions as defined in the instructions.
* (5 pts) Code compiles, runs and gives the correct answer for all entries. Output file is in the same format as the CustFile.txt
* (0 pts) Extra Credit: Code catches lack of update on program exit.
